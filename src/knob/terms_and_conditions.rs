    \n\
    \nThe Doint bot will see almost every action that you perform on Doccord, however **this information will not be stored**, \
    it will only be used to calculate your Doint income and other Doint related actions, then immediately discarded.\

    \nIf you wish to opt out of the Doint system, you may do so at any time by informing a staff member of your intent to do so. \
    Opting out will remove all data associated with you.\
    \n
    \nWhat we currently store:
    \n - User ID: Used to keep track of you in our database, since unlike usernames or nicknames, User IDs do not change.\
